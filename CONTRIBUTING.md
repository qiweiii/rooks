### Creating a new hook

#### New hook

From the root of the project run `yarn new`. This should start the process to create a new hook and set up the package.

Make sure you have Yarn package manager installed globally on your machine.

From the root of the project:

- run `yarn install`

- run `yarn run dev`

### Contributing Guidelines
